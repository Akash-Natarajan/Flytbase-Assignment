# Flytbase-Assignment
These are demo apps created following the flytbase documentation to make a drone takeoff and move in both square and triangle trajectory. 

Square Trajectory:
Drone takeoff to 5m and move in square path with side length as 6.5m at a constant height of 5m.

Triangle Trajectory:
Drone takeoff to 10m and move in triangular path with side length of 10m at a constant height of 10m.

Note: Altitude and side length should be given as arguements for both the programs
